# ROCjs
An interctive diagnostic test ROC learning tool

This is code for a webpage to teach the ideas of sensitivity and specificity and the ROC plot using an interactive explorable explanation 
type tool. (It is also my first attempt at programming in js / using d3.js etc.)

It was modified from an earlier tool I found on the web at:  http://www.navan.name/roc/
